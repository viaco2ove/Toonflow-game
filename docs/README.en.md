# 🌟 Main Features

Toonflow is an AI tool that leverages AI technology to automatically turn novels into scripts, then uses AI to generate images and videos for efficient short drama production. With Toonflow, you can easily accomplish the entire workflow from text to visuals, making short drama creation more intelligent and convenient.

- ✅ **Character Generation**  
   Automatically analyzes the original novel text, intelligently recognizes and generates character profiles, including appearance, personality, identity, etc., providing a reliable foundation for subsequent script and image creation.
- ✅ **Script Generation**  
   Based on selected events and chapters, the system automatically generates structured scripts, covering dialogue, scene descriptions, and plot direction, enabling an efficient transition from literary text to screenplay.
- ✅ **Storyboard Creation**  
   According to the script content, it intelligently generates storyboard prompts and visual designs, detailing foreground, middle ground, background, character movements, props, and scene layouts. Automatically produces storyboards from the script, providing a comprehensive blueprint for video production.
- ✅ **Video Synthesis**  
   Integrates AI image and video techniques, supporting generation of video clips via AI. With built-in online editing, supports personalized adjustments and outputs, making filmmaking highly collaborative and efficient.
